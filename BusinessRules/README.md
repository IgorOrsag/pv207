This example demonstrates how Business Rules can be integrated into the BPMN process by using "Business Rule Task".
It also includes two different approaches to rule authoring:
 1. Technical DRL language where rule is written completely by hand
 2. Guided Decision Table, which uses an editor which helps you to author the rule using a structured table.
